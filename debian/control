 Gutenprint is the print facility for the GIMP, and in addition a
 suite of drivers that may be used with common UNIX spooling systems
 using GhostScript or CUPS.  These drivers provide printing quality
 for UNIX/Linux on a par with proprietary vendor-supplied drivers in
 many cases, and can be used for many of the most demanding printing
 tasks.  Gutenprint was formerly known as Gimp-Print.

Description: inkjet server - Ghostscript driver for Gutenprint
 This package contains the ijsgutenprint binary which provides
 Ghostscript with a Gutenprint driver, including all printers
 supported by Gutenprint.  ijsgutenprint is an IJS server (driver),
 which communicates with Ghostscript (an IJS client) using the IJS
 (InkJet Server) communications protocol.  IJS is a method for
 separating ghostscript drivers from ghostscript, to allow
 ghostscript to be more extensible.

 If you wish to print using Ghostscript and the Gutenprint drivers,
 install this package.  This is typical for LPRng setups.  If you
 are using CUPS, printer-driver-gutenprint is a better choice, but
 this package will still work with the appropriate foomatic setup
 if you wish to make use of foomatic.
