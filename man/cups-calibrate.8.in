This program allows you to calibrate the color output of printers
using the \fIGIMP-PRINT\fP \fICUPS\fP or \fIESP Print Pro\fP drivers.

Please note that this program \fBonly\fP works with the \fIGIMP-PRINT\fP \fICUPS\fP or
\fIESP Print Pro\fP drivers. If you are using the GIMP-Print stp driver of
GhostScript or the drivers of the GIMP-Print plug-in of GIMP, this
